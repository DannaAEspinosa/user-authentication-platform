# Login System for User Management 🔒

This project provides a secure login system to manage users on a platform. It supports two types of users: an administrator who can manage users (view, delete, reset passwords), and common users who can change their passwords and view their last login time. 🧑‍💻

The system uses PBKDF2 for hashing passwords with salt to ensure secure storage 🔐. User data is stored in a text file or database, and the admin has full control over user management.

Key Features:

🧑‍💼 Admin: Manage users, reset passwords, view all users
👩‍💻 Common Users: Change password, view last login
🔒 Secure password storage with hashing (PBKDF2)
Perfect for platforms that need to handle user authentication with simplicity and security! ✨
